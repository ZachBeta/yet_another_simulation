* relativistic physics? map size? maybe we start with positions and velocities that are at a much smaller scale, like 1 meter and 1 meter per second - I can see this being applicable at scales of bacteria, up to galaxies like the powers of 10 videos from Carl Sagan. Eve Online has an interesting way of handling impulse drive vs warp drive vs jump drive to handle operating at different scales
