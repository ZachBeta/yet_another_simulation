# Simulation Engine

> Core system responsible for managing the game state, physics, and agent interactions.

## Core Components

- **World State**: Current state of all entities and environment
- **Physics System**: Movement, collisions, and spatial queries
- **Event System**: Communication between game components
- **Time Management**: Tick-based simulation updates
