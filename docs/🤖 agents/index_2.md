# Agent System

> Autonomous entities that perceive and interact with the simulation environment.

## Core Components

- **Sensors**: How agents perceive their environment
- **Brains**: Decision-making logic and neural networks
- **Actuators**: How agents take actions
- **Memory**: State retention and learning
