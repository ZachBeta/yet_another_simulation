# Neural Network Training

This document explains how to train neural networks using NEAT evolution.

## Overview
NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) is an evolutionary algorithm that evolves neural network topologies.

## Training Process
1. Initialize population
2. Evaluate fitness
3. Select parents
4. Create offspring
5. Repeat until convergence

The fitness function determines how well agents perform in the simulation.
