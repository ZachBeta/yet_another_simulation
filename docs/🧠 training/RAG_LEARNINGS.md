# RAG Experiment Learnings

## TL;DR: Simple Beats Complex (For Our Use Case)

**Benchmark Results (Dec 2024)**: Naive text search **crushed** RAG system 5/5 queries.

- **Speed**: Naive 42x faster (0.008s vs 0.338s average)
- **Results**: Naive found more matches (15 vs 10)
- **Complexity**: 80 lines of regex vs 1000+ lines of ML infrastructure

## The Experiment

Built full RAG system with:
- Vector embeddings (sentence-transformers)
- ChromaDB vector store  
- Semantic chunking
- Similarity search
- Heavy ML dependencies

**Hypothesis**: Semantic search would find better conceptual matches than keyword search.

**Reality**: Our technical docs are well-written with clear terminology. Exact keyword matching works perfectly.

## Where RAG Failed

1. **Cold start penalty**: Model loading overhead
2. **Similarity thresholds**: Too strict for our content
3. **Vector overkill**: Embeddings don't beat exact terms for technical docs
4. **Database overhead**: ChromaDB vs simple file reading

**Embarrassing moments**: RAG failed to find "team configuration" and "neural network evolution" that naive search found instantly.

## Where RAG Would Win

- Fuzzy/conceptual queries across large corpus
- Multi-language content
- Poorly structured documentation  
- Complex reasoning tasks
- Large-scale enterprise search

## The Lesson

**For well-organized technical documentation with clear terminology**: 
- Keep it simple
- Regex + file system beats ML complexity
- Don't solve problems you don't have
- Sometimes the obvious solution is the right solution

## Implementation Note

Full implementation was 1000+ lines across:
- `knowledge_base/models.py` - Data models
- `knowledge_base/chunker.py` - Document chunking
- `knowledge_base/embeddings.py` - Vector embeddings
- `knowledge_base/vector_store.py` - ChromaDB integration
- `knowledge_base/rag.py` - Main RAG system
- `rag_demo.py`, `rag_cli.py` - User interfaces
- Heavy Python dependencies

**Replaced by**: `benchmark_search.py` containing both implementations and proof that naive wins.

## Decision

Spike complete. Learnings captured. Implementation deleted to avoid context pollution.
